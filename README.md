<p style="text-align: center">Buckles Chat Backend (Written in NodeJS + ExpressJS)</p>

This is the backend service for the application BucklesChat, which will soon become a live chat website where users can signup and well, chat with each-other! This project uses a very very strict linter, along with typescript for the maximum code quality. Also comes with a prettier config file to keep formatting consistent throughout. The backend consists of large data stored in a PSQL database, User Session data stored in a redis database, and application logs stored in a MongoDB instance. 3 databases + ExpressJS, this will be a challenge to implement, but it's functionality fine currently.
